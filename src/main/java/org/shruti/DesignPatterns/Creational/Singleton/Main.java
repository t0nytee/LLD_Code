/*
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created.
Global Access: The single instance is globally accessible throughout the application.
Private Constructor: The constructor is private to prevent the direct creation of objects.
Static Method: A static method is used to provide access to the single instance.

usage :
When a class needs to control access to resources (e.g., a connection to a database, logging service, etc.).
When only one instance of a class is needed across the application (e.g., configuration manager, cache, etc.).
